FlatUI-Controls-QML
===================

This is custom made and themed QML controls. The controls are made to look and behave just like [Flat UI Toolkit](http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/). This repository is an improvement over Druage's repository (https://github.com/Druage/FlatUI-Controls-QML).
